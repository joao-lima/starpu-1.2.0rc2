\section TaskSchedulingPolicy Task Scheduling Policy

The basics of the scheduling policy are that

<ul>
<li>The scheduler gets to schedule tasks (<c>push</c> operation) when they become
ready to be executed, i.e. they are not waiting for some tags, data dependencies
or task dependencies.</li>
<li>Workers pull tasks (<c>pop</c> operation) one by one from the scheduler.
</ul>

This means scheduling policies usually contain at least one queue of tasks to
store them between the time when they become available, and the time when a
worker gets to grab them.

By default, StarPU uses the simple greedy scheduler <c>eager</c>. This is
because it provides correct load balance even if the application codelets do not
have performance models. If your application codelets have performance models
(\ref PerformanceModelExample), you should change the scheduler thanks
to the environment variable \ref STARPU_SCHED. For instance <c>export
STARPU_SCHED=dmda</c> . Use <c>help</c> to get the list of available schedulers.

The <b>eager</b> scheduler uses a central task queue, from which all workers draw tasks
to work on concurrently. This however does not permit to prefetch data since the scheduling
decision is taken late. If a task has a non-0 priority, it is put at the front of the queue.

The <b>prio</b> scheduler also uses a central task queue, but sorts tasks by
priority (between -5 and 5).

The <b>random</b> scheduler uses a queue per worker, and distributes tasks randomly according to assumed worker
overall performance.

The <b>ws</b> (work stealing) scheduler uses a queue per worker, and schedules
a task on the worker which released it by
default. When a worker becomes idle, it steals a task from the most loaded
worker.

The <b>lws</b> (locality work stealing) scheduler uses a queue per worker, and schedules
a task on the worker which released it by
default. When a worker becomes idle, it steals a task from neighbour workers. It
also takes into account priorities.

The <b>dm</b> (deque model) scheduler uses task execution performance models into account to
perform a HEFT-similar scheduling strategy: it schedules tasks where their
termination time will be minimal. The difference with HEFT is that <b>dm</b>
schedules tasks as soon as they become available, and thus in the order they
become available, without taking priorities into account.

The <b>dmda</b> (deque model data aware) scheduler is similar to dm, but it also takes
into account data transfer time.

The <b>dmdar</b> (deque model data aware ready) scheduler is similar to dmda,
but it also sorts tasks on per-worker queues by number of already-available data
buffers on the target device.

The <b>dmdas</b> (deque model data aware sorted) scheduler is similar to dmdar,
except that it sorts tasks by priority order, which allows to become even closer
to HEFT by respecting priorities after having made the scheduling decision (but
it still schedules tasks in the order they become available).

The <b>heft</b> (heterogeneous earliest finish time) scheduler is a deprecated
alias for <b>dmda</b>.

The <b>pheft</b> (parallel HEFT) scheduler is similar to dmda, it also supports
parallel tasks (still experimental). Should not be used when several contexts using
it are being executed simultaneously.

The <b>peager</b> (parallel eager) scheduler is similar to eager, it also
supports parallel tasks (still experimental). Should not be used when several 
contexts using it are being executed simultaneously.

\section TaskDistributionVsDataTransfer Task Distribution Vs Data Transfer

Distributing tasks to balance the load induces data transfer penalty. StarPU
thus needs to find a balance between both. The target function that the
scheduler <c>dmda</c> of StarPU
tries to minimize is <c>alpha * T_execution + beta * T_data_transfer</c>, where
<c>T_execution</c> is the estimated execution time of the codelet (usually
accurate), and <c>T_data_transfer</c> is the estimated data transfer time. The
latter is estimated based on bus calibration before execution start,
i.e. with an idle machine, thus without contention. You can force bus
re-calibration by running the tool <c>starpu_calibrate_bus</c>. The
beta parameter defaults to <c>1</c>, but it can be worth trying to tweak it
by using <c>export STARPU_SCHED_BETA=2</c> for instance, since during
real application execution, contention makes transfer times bigger.
This is of course imprecise, but in practice, a rough estimation
already gives the good results that a precise estimation would give.

\section Power-basedScheduling Power-based Scheduling

If the application can provide some power performance model (through
the field starpu_codelet::power_model), StarPU will
take it into account when distributing tasks. The target function that
the scheduler <c>dmda</c> minimizes becomes <c>alpha * T_execution +
beta * T_data_transfer + gamma * Consumption</c> , where <c>Consumption</c>
is the estimated task consumption in Joules. To tune this parameter, use
<c>export STARPU_SCHED_GAMMA=3000</c> for instance, to express that each Joule
(i.e kW during 1000us) is worth 3000us execution time penalty. Setting
<c>alpha</c> and <c>beta</c> to zero permits to only take into account power consumption.

This is however not sufficient to correctly optimize power: the scheduler would
simply tend to run all computations on the most energy-conservative processing
unit. To account for the consumption of the whole machine (including idle
processing units), the idle power of the machine should be given by setting
<c>export STARPU_IDLE_POWER=200</c> for 200W, for instance. This value can often
be obtained from the machine power supplier.

The power actually consumed by the total execution can be displayed by setting
<c>export STARPU_PROFILING=1 STARPU_WORKER_STATS=1</c> .

On-line task consumption measurement is currently only supported through the
<c>CL_PROFILING_POWER_CONSUMED</c> OpenCL extension, implemented in the MoviSim
simulator. Applications can however provide explicit measurements by
using the function starpu_perfmodel_update_history() (examplified in \ref PerformanceModelExample
with the <c>power_model</c> performance model). Fine-grain
measurement is often not feasible with the feedback provided by the hardware, so
the user can for instance run a given task a thousand times, measure the global
consumption for that series of tasks, divide it by a thousand, repeat for
varying kinds of tasks and task sizes, and eventually feed StarPU
with these manual measurements through starpu_perfmodel_update_history().
For instance, for CUDA devices, <c>nvidia-smi -q -d POWER</c> can be used to get
the current consumption in Watt. Multiplying that value by the average duration
of a single task gives the consumption of the task in Joules, which can be given
to starpu_perfmodel_update_history().

\section StaticScheduling Static Scheduling

In some cases, one may want to force some scheduling, for instance force a given
set of tasks to GPU0, another set to GPU1, etc. while letting some other tasks
be scheduled on any other device. This can indeed be useful to guide StarPU into
some work distribution, while still letting some degree of dynamism. For
instance, to force execution of a task on CUDA0:

\code{.c}
task->execute_on_a_specific_worker = 1;
task->worker = starpu_worker_get_by_type(STARPU_CUDA_WORKER, 0);
\endcode

One can also specify the order in which tasks must be executed by setting the
starpu_task::workerder field. If this field is set to a non-zero value, it
provides the per-worker consecutive order in which tasks will be executed,
starting from 1. For a given of such task, the worker will thus not execute
it before all the tasks with smaller order value have been executed, notably
in case those tasks are not available yet due to some dependencies. This
eventually gives total control of task scheduling, and StarPU will only serve as
a "self-timed" task runtime. Of course, the provided order has to be runnable,
i.e. a task should should not depend on another task bound to the same worker
with a bigger order.

Note however that using scheduling contexts while statically scheduling tasks on workers
could be tricky. Be careful to schedule the tasks exactly on the workers of the corresponding
contexts, otherwise the workers' corresponding scheduling structures may not be allocated or
the execution of the application may deadlock. Moreover, the hypervisor should not be used when
statically scheduling tasks.

\section DefiningANewSchedulingPolicy Defining A New Scheduling Policy

A full example showing how to define a new scheduling policy is available in
the StarPU sources in the directory <c>examples/scheduler/</c>.

See \ref API_Scheduling_Policy

\code{.c}
static struct starpu_sched_policy dummy_sched_policy = {
    .init_sched = init_dummy_sched,
    .deinit_sched = deinit_dummy_sched,
    .add_workers = dummy_sched_add_workers,
    .remove_workers = dummy_sched_remove_workers,
    .push_task = push_task_dummy,
    .push_prio_task = NULL,
    .pop_task = pop_task_dummy,
    .post_exec_hook = NULL,
    .pop_every_task = NULL,
    .policy_name = "dummy",
    .policy_description = "dummy scheduling strategy"
};
\endcode
